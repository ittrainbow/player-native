React Native mp3 player

Track artist/title data is fetched from filenames (`${artist} - ${title}.mp3` file format) while I was tired of looking for properly working metadata fetching tool that is compatible with actual Expo SDK version, so app is not for my personal uses only 'cause it not've been tested with other way styled filenames 

Built with Expo SDK 48
